# Unlocking Business Intelligence for AEC Manufacturers with Compute Version Control

_In the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector, there is a lack of flexibility
present in disciplines such as software development, where specific libraries can be easily imported
and used.
This project aims to develop a tool that allows architects and computational designers to quickly
test **parametric
manufacturers' constructive solutions, from the web into any of their tools**. Additionally,
manufacturers will be able to **obtain
information** about the use of their products and customer needs._

## Overview

`Compute Version Control` (VSC) aims to provide a comprehensive version control system that
validates
design proposals based on design and constructive system constraints. These constraints are provided
by manufacturers and return essential information about key indicators such as cost, material,
geometrical constraints, and lifecycle data.

### Benefits and Business Intelligence

This system offers several benefits and unlocks numerous possibilities from a
`business intelligence`
perspective:

- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Detailed insights into the lifecycle of materials and their
  associated data allow businesses to make informed decisions regarding material selection and
  project planning.
- **Improved Compliance**: Ensures that all design proposals adhere to manufacturer-provided
  constraints, improving compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Integration with Relational Databases and Speckle provides robust data
  management
  and retrieval, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights from project interactions.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Automates validation and management of design proposals, reducing manual
  effort and increasing efficiency.
- **Scalability**: The modular architecture allows for easy scalability to accommodate growing
  business needs.

### Architecture Approach

The application consists of three primary components:

1. **Rhino Compute**: Handles predefined manufactured systems. It generates constructive solutions,
   such as creating glass facades from provided input surfaces.
2. **Speckle**: A data repository model that provides storage for baked geometry. Speckle is
   particularly useful for managing geometry IDs, variations, and provides tools for filtering and
   differentiation.
3. **Relational Database**: Associates geometry IDs with lifecycle data, providing efficient data
   tracking and retrieval.

This project delivers a robust solution for managing and validating design proposals, enhancing
accuracy and efficiency by leveraging manufacturer-provided constraints.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of two Docker containers: one for the Node.js project (Rhino Compute server)
and one for the Python project [DASH](https://dash.plotly.com/) web application . Both containers
communicate within the same
network.

- **Grasshopper Project**: The main tool for creating the geometry and the logic of the building.
- **Node.js Project**: Rhino Compute server, responsible for generating geometry
  data.
- **Python Project**: Dash application that interacts with the Node.js project, providing a user
  interface for visualization.

  managing construction model data, processing commits, and integrating version control features
  into project workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The aim of this project is developing a minimum viable product (MVP) to test the interaction
> and the link with the Business Intelligence (BI) of the manufacturers.
> Only the [Dolcker & Clip](https://dolcker.es/dolcker-system#descargas) system by Dolcker has been
> implemented.
> The project is only tested on a local machine and is not yet deployed to a production server
> (Speckle Server, Rhino Compute).

### Input Data

The input data for the project consists of a surface representing the facade of a building. This
is a black ceramic with vertical textures. I need to adapt the default Dolcker & Clip system to
mimic the facade's texture and color.

</div>


*Figure 2: Reference image of the facade to be replicated in the Dolcker & Clip system and the

### User Interface Overview

The main focus of this repository is to provide a user-friendly interface for architects to
import their facade designs and test with the manufacturers' systems.
The user interface consists of three primary sections: the landing page and two side panels.

- **Landing Page**: Features a split-screen view showcasing the model stored in Speckle alongside
  the model generated by Rhino Compute. Users can adjust parameters to interactively modify the
  model, with updates reflected in real-time.

- **Speckle Optimal Commit Panel**: Displays relevant metadata of the model and allows users to
  filter and select specific commits based on chosen parameters, providing insights into the most
  suitable versions.

- **Speckle Parts Panel**: Lists individual model components, including part counts per group. It
  offers detailed information for each component, such as cost, material, and lifecycle data, giving
  users a comprehensive overview of the model's structure.

## Main Systems

### Rhino Compute

This service provides a cloud-based, `stateless REST API` for performing geometry calculations on
various objects like points, curves, surfaces, meshes, and solids. The solution supports integration
with Rhino/Grasshopper plugins and allows
serialization of operations through `Grasshopper or Python scripts`.

The script hosted in
the [compute.rhino3d.appserver](https://github.com/mcneel/compute.rhino3d.appserver) repository has
unique input and output
characteristics. Both use
Speckle components to read and send working versions. The key components are:

- Read Component: Retrieves geometry from the Speckle server.
- Manufacturer Geometrical Logic: Generates geometry based on manufacturer constraints.
- Send Component: Sends geometry to the Speckle server.
- Visualize Component: Displays geometry in the appserver.

> [!NOTE]
> **Parametric vs. Block**: Defining the geometrical logic of the systems allows not only the
> placement of identical blocks in different positions, but also the creation of an informed system
> based on input geometrical constraints.

### Speckle Systems

[Speckle](https://speckle.systems/) provides a `version control system` for all baked geometry and
is useful for managing
geometry, associated data and
their
variations. The Speckle iframe is used to display geometry and its variations in the web
application.

Speckle plays a crucial role in the project by managing client input geometry, building the
infrastructure to store its data along with associated metadata, and providing an intuitive way to
interact within its python integration. Additionally, Speckle facilitates storing the
output geometry and metadata from the Rhino Compute service, allowing this updated information to be
returned to the **original tool where the client is working**.

- **Geometry**: Created by Grasshopper and Rhino Compute.
- **System Parts**: Components associated with the geometry.
- **Part Data**: Data linked with each system part.
- **Metadata**: Additional data about geometry.

Further Steps:

- Resolve the Speckle read component failure in Grasshopper.
- [Deploy the Speckle Server](https://speckle.guide/dev/server-manual-setup.html)

```mermaid

    TRANSFORMED_SURFACE -->|stores| SPECKLE
    SYSTEM_PARTS -->|associates| SPECKLE
    PART_DATA -->|associates| SPECKLE
```

*Diagram 2: Specific interaction login within Speckle service.*

In this diagram:

- `CLIENT_INPUT_GEOMETRY` represents the client's input geometry, such as a surface of a facade.
- `RHINO_COMPUTE` represents the Rhino Compute component that processes the client's input geometry
  and creates the
  transformed surface.
- `TRANSFORMED_SURFACE` represents the new surface created by Rhino Compute.
- `SYSTEM_PARTS` represents the parts of the system that are associated with the transformed
  surface.
- `PART_DATA` represents the data associated with each part of the system.
- `SPECKLE` represents the Speckle component that stores the transformed surface, the system parts,
  and the part data.

The input data is a surface that represents the facade of a building. The output data is a 3D
model of the facade with the Dolcker & Clip system applied. The **Rhino/Grasshopper connectors** by
Speckle are used to read and send the geometry data to
the [Speckle server](https://app.speckle.systems/projects/013613abb4/models/8d916b252e).

### Relational Database

This project uses `PostgreSQL` as the primary database systems to reflect the business logic
of the project. It stores and
manages
construction related data, users and interactions.

- **Storing Geometry Data**: PostgreSQL stores geometry created by Rhino Compute, with each geometry
  piece assigned a unique ID managed by Speckle.
- **Storing Parameter Variations**: Stores variations in parameters for constructive systems,
  tracking user changes.
- **Storing Constructive System Data**: Stores information about constructive systems, allowing
  tracking of their usage in projects.

Further Steps:

- **Associating Geometry with Material Lifecycle Data**: PostgreSQL associates geometry with
  lifecycle data, enabling material tracking throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Storing User Data**: Stores user information, tracking project ownership and parameter
  variations.
